# Neo4j REST API Wrapper for Node.js

---

## Installation

    npm install node-neo4j

## Usage

In order to use the library you either have to create a [heroku](http://www.heroku.com/) app and add the [Neo4j Addon](https://addons.heroku.com/neo4j) there or install it locally. If you're using OS X i highly recommend installing Neo4j via [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/).

    $ brew install neo4j
    $ neo4j start

Instantiate a wrapper instance.

    var neo4j = require('node-neo4j);
    db = new neo4j('http://username:password@domain:port');
        
Insert a Node.

    db.InsertNode({
        name: 'Darth Vader',
        sex: 'male'
    },
    function(err, node){
        
        // Output Node properties.
        console.log(node.data);
        
        // Output Node id.
        console.log(node.id);
    });
        
## Tests

This API wrapper relies on [mocha](https://github.com/visionmedia/mocha) for testing, therefore when you want to run the tests follow the steps below.

    $ git clone git://github.com/philippkueng/node-neo4j.git
    $ cd node-neo4j/
    $ npm install
    $ npm test
